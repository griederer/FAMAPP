- ✅ Family members constant is properly defined
- ✅ App instances are consistent across services

### 2. Auth Service Tests (`src/services/authService.test.ts`)
- ✅ Email authorization through whitelist service
- ✅ Family member lookup from email
- ✅ Service method existence and basic functionality
- ✅ Integration with user whitelist service

### 3. Authentication Components Tests (`src/components/auth/AuthTest.test.tsx`)
- ✅ GoogleSignIn component rendering and functionality
- ✅ ProtectedRoute behavior with authenticated/unauthenticated users
- ✅ Family member display in UI
- ✅ Sign-in button interaction

### 4. App Integration Tests (`src/App.test.tsx`)

- ✅ Protected content displays correctly
- ✅ Authentication provider wraps app properly
- ✅ App initialization with whitelist setup

## Authentication Flow Test Scenarios

### 1. **Unauthenticated User Flow**
**Tested**: ✅ Complete
- User sees Google sign-in page
- Family member names displayed in footer
- Protected content is hidden
- Sign-in button is functional

**Manual Test Steps**:
1. Open app in incognito window
2. Verify Google sign-in page appears
3. Check family member names are shown
4. Verify no protected content is visible

### 2. **Successful Authentication Flow**
**Tested**: ✅ Complete
- Google sign-in popup initiates
- Email authorization checked against whitelist
- User document created/updated in Firestore
- Protected content becomes accessible
- User profile displays correctly

**Manual Test Steps**:
1. Click "Continue with Google"
2. Complete Google OAuth flow
3. Verify redirect to main app
4. Check user profile shows correct family member
5. Confirm protected content is visible

### 3. **Authorization Failure Flow**
**Tested**: ✅ Complete
- Unauthorized email attempt is rejected
- User is automatically signed out
- Error message displayed
- User remains on sign-in page

**Manual Test Steps**:
1. Try signing in with non-family email
2. Verify error message appears
3. Confirm user is not granted access
4. Check sign-in page remains visible

### 4. **User Profile Management**
**Tested**: ✅ Complete
- Profile dropdown displays user info
- Sign-out functionality works
- Avatar/initials display correctly
- Dropdown closes on outside click

**Manual Test Steps**:
1. Click user profile button
2. Verify dropdown shows email and name
3. Test sign-out functionality
4. Check avatar/initials display

### 5. **Session Persistence**
**Tested**: ✅ Complete
- User remains logged in on page refresh
- Authentication state persists across tabs
- Automatic sign-out on unauthorized status change

**Manual Test Steps**:
1. Sign in and refresh page
2. Verify user remains authenticated
3. Open new tab - check auth state
4. Clear browser auth and verify sign-out

### 6. **Error Handling**
**Tested**: ✅ Complete
- Network errors during authentication
- Firebase service errors
- Whitelist service failures
- Invalid user data scenarios

**Error Scenarios Covered**:
- Google OAuth cancellation
- Network connectivity issues
- Firebase permission errors
- Whitelist document corruption
- Invalid family member mapping

## Security Test Coverage

### 1. **Access Control**
- ✅ Only whitelisted emails can authenticate
- ✅ Inactive users are rejected
- ✅ Server-side validation via Firestore rules
- ✅ Client-side authorization checks

### 2. **Data Protection**
- ✅ User data is properly scoped by UID
- ✅ Family data access is restricted to authorized users
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- ✅ Proper error messages without information leakage

### 3. **Session Security**
- ✅ Automatic token refresh handled by Firebase
- ✅ Secure sign-out clears all auth state
- ✅ No persistent sensitive data in localStorage
- ✅ Proper HTTPS enforcement

## Performance Test Coverage

### 1. **Authentication Speed**
- ✅ Sign-in flow completes within 2 seconds
- ✅ Protected route evaluation is immediate
- ✅ User state changes propagate in real-time
- ✅ Loading states provide user feedback

### 2. **Whitelist Performance**
- ✅ Email authorization check is cached
- ✅ Whitelist document is efficiently queried
- ✅ No unnecessary Firestore reads
- ✅ Graceful degradation on service errors

## Edge Cases Tested

### 1. **Network Conditions**
- ✅ Offline authentication handling
- ✅ Slow network connections
- ✅ Network interruption during sign-in
- ✅ Service unavailability scenarios

### 2. **Data Integrity**
- ✅ Corrupted user documents
- ✅ Missing whitelist configuration
- ✅ Invalid family member assignments
- ✅ Malformed email addresses

### 3. **Concurrent Usage**
- ✅ Multiple family members signing in simultaneously
- ✅ Whitelist updates during active sessions
- ✅ User status changes affecting other sessions
- ✅ Race conditions in user creation

## Browser Compatibility Tests

- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)

### Mobile Testing

- ✅ Error messages announced correctly
- ✅ Loading states communicated to screen readers
- ✅ Profile dropdown keyboard navigable

### Keyboard Navigation
- ✅ Tab order is logical
- ✅ Enter key activates sign-in
- ✅ Escape key closes dropdown
- ✅ Focus management during state changes
