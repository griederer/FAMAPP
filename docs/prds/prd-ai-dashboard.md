# Product Requirement Document: AI-Powered Family Dashboard

## Overview

Develop an intelligent family dashboard that uses AI to provide personalized insights, summaries, and recommendations based on the family's todos, upcoming events, and grocery lists. The dashboard will serve as a smart home command center, offering real-time analysis and conversational interactions.

## Goals

1. **Intelligent Insights**: Provide AI-generated summaries and trend analysis of family activities
2. **Proactive Assistance**: Offer smart recommendations and alerts based on family data
3. **Conversational Interface**: Enable natural language queries about family activities
4. **Visual Overview**: Present information through intuitive visual cards and summaries
5. **Real-time Intelligence**: Generate fresh insights when users access the dashboard

## User Stories

**As a family member, I want to:**
- See an AI-generated summary of our family's upcoming activities and pending tasks
- Get smart recommendations about what needs attention (shopping, upcoming deadlines)
- Ask specific questions like "What events does Borja have this week?" or "What groceries are we missing?"
- Receive intelligent alerts about important upcoming events or deadlines
- View trend analysis to understand our family patterns and productivity
- Get proactive suggestions to optimize our family organization

**As a parent, I want to:**
- Quickly understand the family's status without checking multiple sections
- Get alerts about children's activities and deadlines
- See patterns in family behavior to make better planning decisions
- Receive recommendations for family time management

- Aggregate todos, events, and groceries across all family members
- Respect existing data permissions and family member access

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Push notifications based on AI insights
- Automated task creation or modification
- Integration with external calendar systems beyond current scope
- Voice interface or speech recognition
- Mobile-specific AI features (focus on web implementation)
- Historical data storage beyond current app data
- AI model training or custom ML implementations

## Technical Considerations

### AI Integration
- Use Claude API (Anthropic) for natural language processing
- Real-time generation on dashboard access (no caching initially)
- Structured prompts for consistent, useful outputs
- Error handling for API failures with graceful fallbacks

### Architecture
- New AI service layer in shared package for reusability
- Dashboard component in web package
- Firestore integration for data fetching
- Environment variable configuration for API keys

### Performance
- Optimize data fetching with single consolidated query
- Implement loading states for AI generation
- Handle API rate limits gracefully
- Ensure responsive UI during AI processing

### Security
- Secure API key management
- Data privacy compliance for AI processing
- No storage of AI conversations beyond session
- Maintain existing authentication and authorization

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Dashboard becomes primary landing page for family members
2. **Query Success Rate**: >90% of natural language queries return useful responses
3. **Response Time**: AI summaries generated within 3-5 seconds
4. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on AI recommendations and insights
5. **Data Coverage**: AI successfully analyzes 100% of available family data
6. **Error Rate**: <5% API failures with proper fallback handling

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement conversation memory across sessions, or keep it session-only?
2. How should we handle edge cases when family has no data (new users)?
3. Should we provide user controls to adjust AI summary frequency or depth?
4. Do we need admin controls to monitor AI usage and costs?

## Test Scenarios for AI Features

### Happy Path Testing
- Dashboard loads with complete family data → AI generates comprehensive summary
- User asks "What events does Mpaz have this week?" → AI provides accurate response
- Family has overdue todos → AI generates appropriate alerts and recommendations

### Edge Case Testing
- Empty family data → AI provides helpful onboarding suggestions
- API failure → Graceful fallback with cached summary or manual overview
- Very large datasets → AI handles data efficiently without timeout
- Malformed user questions → AI provides helpful clarification prompts

### Load Testing
- Multiple simultaneous dashboard accesses → API handles concurrent requests
- Extended conversation sessions → Performance remains stable
- Large family datasets → Response times stay under 5 seconds
