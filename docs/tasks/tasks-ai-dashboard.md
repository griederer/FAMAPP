## Implementation Rules

### ðŸ”’ **Stability & GitHub Backup**
- Every subtask completion MUST include a GitHub commit
- Test existing functionality before committing changes
- Never commit broken code or failing tests
- Use meaningful commit messages with feature context

### ðŸ§ª **Testing Requirements**
- Unit tests MUST be written for every new component/service
- Integration tests MUST cover AI workflow end-to-end
- All tests MUST pass before marking task complete
- Maintain >90% code coverage for new code

### ðŸš€ **Performance Standards**
- AI responses MUST complete within 5 seconds
- Dashboard loading MUST not impact existing app performance
- Handle API rate limits and failures gracefully
- Optimize data fetching to minimize Firestore reads

**Ready to Start**: Begin with task 1.1 and wait for approval after each completion.
